App.co accepts submissions from all decentralized protocols such as Ethereum,
Blockstack, and many others. Only applications that integrate Blockstack
authentication, use GAI storage, and which are accessible to review can
participate in application mining.

## Marketing your DApp

Blockstack reviews each submission to app mining. Through this contact, Blockstack helps
developers refine business models and facilitating interactions with investors.
Two areas that Blockstack assists are pre-funding and pitching.

* **Pre-funding.** Directed toward developers that have a proof of concept of either a blockchain application or an integration  with Blockstackâ€™s techology.  Blockstack helps with sourcing of developers and designers. We can also help with direct access to our core team members that can help you refine or optimize your product.
* **Pitching investors.**  Blockstack can help you with access to an extensive investor community. Prior to arranging meetings we can give you resources to refine and craft your pitch for the blockchain market.

In addition to app mining, Blockstack offers both a community reward program.
Community rewards give users the ability to earn tokens for accomplishing tasks.
For example, some of the latest ways user can earn money include:

- Organize a Blockstack Hackathon
- Message of the founders of `stealthy.im` with feedback and ideas
- Use graphite to write a message about the problems decentralization solves
