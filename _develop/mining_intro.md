## How apps are reviewed and ranked

Blockstack uses the third-party reviewers: 

* Awario
* TryMyUI
* Internet Labs. 

These reviewers are independent, and generally rely on their own proprietary data and insights to generate rankings.

{% include payout-appmining.md %}

This first release of App Mining uses the initial version of our ranking and
payout mechanism. Blockstack has taken care to be thoughtful and fair, but
things may change as we learn more and get feedback from the community. Please
let us know what you think by commenting <a href="https://forum.blockstack.org"
target="\_blank">in our forum</a> or by emailing us at <hello@app.co>!

The ranking and payout mechanisms are under constant review and are documented at <a href="https://github.com/blockstack/app-mining">the app mining's github repository</a>.
