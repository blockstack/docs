# How to enroll

Application mining pays developers for building decentralized applications
(DApps). Enrolling in app mining also makes your application eligible for
rewards.

After you enroll, Blockstack verifies your information and your DApp appears in
the list of registered apps. You must enroll by the end of each month to be
eligible for the following month.

To apply, do the following:

1. Integrate Blockstack Auth into your app.

   Your application code can reside in a public or a private repository.

2. Add your app to <a href="https://app.co/submit" target="\_blank">App.co</a>.

   Make sure you choose Blockstack from the Authentication list on the form.

3. Email <app.mining@blockstack.com> with the domain you used to register for your app.

   Blockstack will respond via email with a set of verification materials.

4. Fill out and return the completed verification materials.

   Be sure you provide us with the BTC address for receipt of mining and rewards funds.

   {% include warning.html content="You must complete enrollment including <b>submission of verification materials and BTC address</b> by the end of each month to be eligible for the following month. If your submission is incomplete on the last day of the end of the month, it will not be reviewed. You should register early to allow for sufficient time for collection of additional materials." %}

Once your enrollment is received, you appear in the enrollment list. For more information, see the frequently asked questions [on the App.co site](https://app.co/mining#faq).
