1. Create an application that integrates Blockstack Auth.

   Your application code can reside in a public or a private repository.

2. Choose <a href="https://app.co/submit" target="\_blank"><strong>Submit app</strong></a> from the App.co site.

3. Sign into the submission form with your Blockstack ID.

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Payment Details</strong></td>
        <td>Presently, App Mining payments are made in Bitcoin (BTC) but we anticipate paying in Stacks (STX) soon. For your Stacks payment to start accruing for future delivery, you must provide both BTC and STX addresses. Your app cannot participate in App Mining without Blockstack having both address types on file. To get a STX address, you need to install the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/org/wallet-install.html" target="_blank">Stacks Wallet</a>. </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>Identity verification</strong></td>
        <td>We are ready to pay you Bitcoin and Stacks tokens for building a great Blockstack app, but we also need to comply with all applicable laws. This means we must confirm your identity before you can participate in App Mining. Identity verification is a process designed to confirm your identity and protect you from identity theft. You must submit an image of your ID document, which is checked to ensure it is legitimate and has not been altered or manipulated. Valid identity documents are a passport, an identity card, or a driver's license.

    <tr>
        <td><strong>Legal Documents</strong></td>
        <td> <p>The documents you provide depend on who is representing the app. Once you provide an email and select how you want to represent yourself, you see two sections:</p>
        <p><strong>Document Signing</strong>: You must sign our participation agreement to become eligible to participate in App Mining. Signing is a process, you provide an email and download some accompanying materials. Then, you complete the signing process via an online process.</p>
