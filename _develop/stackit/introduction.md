# Introduction to the Stackit tutorial

In this tutorial, you start from a template and build a multi-page decentralized application (dApp). The final Stackit app  makes use of all the features of the Blockstack platform. 

## What you will build.

Before you begin, you should learn what you are building.

### How is a Web 3.0 Dapp Different from a 2.0 app?

Decentralied Dapps don't store user data. 
Your application data is stored on gaia
Multi-player versus single player storage;multi

### Single vs Multi-player application

First, we launched Blockstack Auth, which provided you with a single-sign on you could use with apps to privately access them without any 3rd parties involved. This put identity back in the hands of users.

Next, we enabled Single-Player Storage, which gave you the ability to store all of your app data privately. This is useful for data that should only be accessed by you, like managing your own private token portfolio app.

The logical next step for our community is to enable Multi-Player Storage for decentralized apps, where you, the user, can not only own and control access to your own data, but also share it with your friends without the need for a third party.
