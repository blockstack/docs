# Learm more about the Stacks token

Stacks is the name of utility token developed by Blockstack Token LLC. in 2017
and activated in the third quarter 2018. This page discusses a general history
of the Stacks token, its current capabilities, and the future capabilities of
the token.

If you are a developer interested in the specific technical changes related to
the 2018 launch, see the [announcement in the Blockstack Forum](#).

## A brief history of the Stacks token

In 2017 Blockstack did an initial coin offering (ICO). Investors in that ICO
received allocations of Stacks token in a draft version of the genesis block. A
genesis block is the first block of a blockchain.

During the draft period, investors were given access to wallet software or they
used their own hardware wallet. Investors created a seed phrase with their
wallet and stored this seed phrase (sometimes referred to as a _recovery phrase_
or a _recovery seed_. It was each investors responsibility to store their own
seed phrase in a private and secure location.  

A draft of the genesis block allowed investors to to search for and verify their
allocation using addresses provided by their wallet. Beyond that, while in draft
state, investors were locked out of using their allotted tokens.

## State of the Stacks blockchain V1

The initial block in the Stacks blockchain V1. that will allocate 1.32 billion
tokens. The launch is the culmination of two yearâ€™s hard work across the greater
Blockstack community. With the launch, Stacks tokens unlock for accredited investors under a
predetermined unlocking schedule. The events on the unlocking schedule are the
same for each investor, *the dates of these events* depend on the investor's
purchase date.

Prior to the genesis launch, Blockstack's blockchain transactions were
fueled by bitcoin. With the launch of the Stacks blockchain, V1, this will
continue to be the case. However, the launch is the first step toward a future
Stacks blockchain V2 where there is no longer a reliance on bitcoin.

This launch makes possible the following interactions:

* Investors can purchase names and namespaces with the Stacks token. Previously, names and namespaces required the
purchaser to hold Bitcoin. Initially, will be through the Blockstack command-line interface.

* Application developers an earn Stacks by building application on the Blockstack ecosystem.

* Any Stacks tokens held at the time of launch or hold remain useable under the Blockstack Core platform.

Finally, in addition to development of Stacks token, this launch enables further
development of Blockstack Core itself.


## Future projects of the Stacks token

The fourth quarter 2018 genesis launch is significant in that it enables the
development of new capabilities and programs for the Blockstack ecosystem.  For
example, the Stacks launch enables the growth of these programs related to mining
and distribution:

    <td>Leader Election Mining</td>
    <td>Miners earn Stacks by burning bitcoin as fuel to generate and validate the next Stacks block.</td>
    <td>2019</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Web-of-trust mining</td>
    <td>Network users earn Stacks by performing an identity verification with a trusted party.</td>
    <td>2019</td>
  </tr>
</table>


Following shortly on the launch of the genesis block, Blockstack PBC will
release a new Stacks wallet. This wallet will enable users to check their Stacks
balance and, in future releases, send and receive Stacks tokens themselves.
