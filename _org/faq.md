## Stacks wallet


### What is a seed phrase?

When you create a wallet address, you also create a seed phrase. With one significant
exception, a seed phrase is similar to a banking pin in that it gives you access
to your wallet and your token allocation. Unlike a pin, if you lose
your seed phrase **you can never access your wallet or your token allocation
ever again**.

{% include warning.html content="Losing a seed phrase is final and destructive. Blockstack does not keep a copy of your seed. Blockstack cannot give you a new seed, get your access to your wallet, or return your tokens if you lose your seed phrase." %}

Keep your seed phrase secret. Just as with a banking pin, anyone that knows or
steals your seed phrase can access your allocation.

You should write your seed phrase down and store the paper you write on in at
least two secure locations. A safe or lock box is a good location. You can also
store it online in an encrypted password manager such as 1Password.  You should
_never_ simply store a seed phrase in Apple Cloud or Dropbox.

### How do I keep my tokens secure?

The safety of your Stacks Tokens is extremely important to us. To help ensure
that you complete the process of receiving your tokens correctly and securely,
please read the following guidelines:

* **Website Safety**: When inputting data on a website or verifying the presence of data on a website it is essential that you confirm that the URL is correct and that your browser is using HTTPS.

* **Email Safety**: Blockstack will never ask for your personal identifying information over e-mail, or call you directly. When we ask verifying questions, we will only do so when you call us to confirm your identity. We will never ask you for money or your Seed Phrase (private key).

If you have large token holdings, make sure you take advantage of custodial
services. A wallet does not provide the security of a custodial service.

### When will the new Stacks wallet be available?

An initial version of the Stacks wallet was released for the token sale.  With the
launch of the Stacks genesis block, that software wallet was retired. An updated version of the
Stacks wallet is expected to be released in November 2018.  

### What is a public Stacks wallet address?

During the initial grant process, investors submitted a _public
Stacks wallet address_ to Blockstack. This is a string of letters and numbers
starting with an 'SP' or SM', for example
`SP017AUV5YRM7HT3TSQXJF7FCCYXETAB276BQ6XY` is a wallet address.

If you purchased Stacks tokens through CoinList, you can find your address at
[CoinList](https://coinlist.co/distributions). If you submitted your Stacks address directly to Blockstack, you can either use the “Restore from Seed Phrase” feature on the Stacks wallet or contact us at <hello@stackstoken.com> for help.


### How do I get help from a person?

## Stacks tokens

### Where can I buy Stacks?

Blockstack Token LLC (“Blockstack”) is not currently offering Stacks for sale. Please keep an eye out for updates at stackstoken.com, where you may also subscribe for updates by joining our mailing list.


### I have a voucher for Stacks. When can I redeem my voucher?

We cannot currently comment on future sales or offers of Stacks. Please keep an eye out for updates at stackstoken.com, where you may also subscribe for updates by joining our mailing list. Thanks for your patience!


### Is there an exchange where I can buy and sell Stacks?

There is currently no authorized exchange for buying and selling Stacks or Stacks futures, and we cannot comment on when an exchange might list Stacks at this time. Please keep an eye out for updates at stackstoken.com. If you see Stacks listed on an exchange, please let us know at legal@blockstack.com, as the listing may be illegal or a scam.


### Can I sell or transfer Stacks directly to someone else?

If you purchased Stacks from our 2017 token sale, it may be possible to sell or
transfer Stacks directly to another person in a peer-to-peer transaction. We
recommend you consult an attorney before engaging in such a transaction,
especially if buying or selling from or to a U.S. person or entity, as we cannot
give you legal or regulatory advice.


### What is the Stacks holding or lock-up period?

Stacks purchased from our 2017 token sale are subject to two separate holding or lock-up periods that run in tandem: (1) a one-year holding period required by law that prohibits sale or transfer of Stacks within one year of the date of purchase of the SAFT or fund interests that gave you the right to tokens, and (2) a monthly time-lock built into our blockchain that unlocks 1/24th of your Stacks on the date of the Blockchain launch on October 29, 2018, and then an additional 1/24th approximately each month thereafter. Because the 2017 token sale took place over one year ago, the one-year holding period should be over for most investors. You may check the status of your monthly time-lock at https://explorer.blockstack.org/.


### I have a tax question about my Stacks. Whom should I talk to?

If you have a tax question about your Stacks, we recommend you speak to an accountant or tax lawyer. If you participated in the 2017 token sale through the Blockstack Token Funds, we’ll provide you with the necessary tax reporting forms by the required deadlines, but in general, we cannot give you tax advice.
