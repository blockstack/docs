### What is a seed phrase?

When you create a wallet you receive a _seed phrase_. With one very important
exception, a seed phrase is similar to a banking pin in that it gives you
access to your wallet and the tokens it contains.  The exception is, that if you
lose your seed phrase **you can never access your wallet or the tokens it contains
ever again**.

{% include warning.html content="Losing a seed phrase is final and destructive.
Blockstack does not keep a copy of your seed. Blockstack cannot give you a new
seed, get your access to your wallet, or return your tokens if you lose your
seed phrase." %}

Keep your seed phrase secret. Just as with a banking pin, anyone that knows or
steals your seed phrase can access your tokens.

You should write your seed phrase down and store the paper you write on in at
least two secure locations. A safe or lock box is a good location. You can also
store it online in a password manager.

### How do I keep my tokens secure?

The safety of your Stacks Tokens is extremely important to us. To help ensure
that you complete the process of receiving your tokens correctly and securely,
please read the following guidelines:

* **Website Safety**. When inputting data on a website or verifying the presence of data on a website it is important that you confirm that the URL is correct, and that your browser is using `HTTPS`.

**Email Safety**: Blockstack will never ask for your personal identifying information over e-mail, or call you directly. When we ask verifying questions, we will only do so when you call us in order to confirm your identity. We will never ask you for money or your Seed Phrase (private key).

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact <token@blockstack.org> .

### What is a public Stacks wallet address?

During the initial grant process, investors should have submitted a _public Stacks wallet address_ to Blockstack. This an string of letters and numbers starting with an 'SP' or SM', for example `SP077AFV5YRM7HT3TSQXJF7FCCYXETAB276BQ6XS` is a wallet address. The wallet address comes from XXXX?
