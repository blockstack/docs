For each App Mining cohort, there is a determined “pot” of total earnings that
will get paid to apps. For the Alpha run, App Mining paid a total of $25,000
USD. However, in
December 2018, App Mining began paying $100,000 USD  each month, with earnings
paid out in Bitcoin.

The top app gets paid 20% of the total pot. So, for a pot of $100k, the top app
receives $20,000 USD. The next app gets paid 20% of the remaining pot. The
remaining pot is $80k, and 20% of that is $16,000. This process continues until
every app has been paid.

Here is a chart that visualizes the decay in rewards, depending on rank:
