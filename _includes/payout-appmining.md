For each App Mining cohort, there is a determined “pot” of total earnings that will
get paid to apps. For the Alpha run, Blockstack paid a total of $25,000 USD. Starting in
December 2018, Blockstack will pay $100,000 USD and the awards will be paid out in Bitcoin.

The top app gets paid 20% of the total pot. So, for a pot of $100k, the top app
receives $20,000 USD. The next app gets paid 20% of the remaining pot. The
remaining pot is $80k, and 20% of that is $16,000. This process continues until
every app has been paid.

Here is a chart that visualizes the decay in rewards, depending on rank:
