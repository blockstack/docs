To create an initial Blockstack ID, do the following:

1. Open the <a href="https://browser.blockstack.org/sign-up?redirect=%2F" target="\_blank">Blockstack web application in your browser</a>.

   The application prompts you to create or restore an ID.

   ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/browser/images/create-id-0.png)

2. Choose **Create new ID**.

   The browser prompts you to register a unique username in the `id.blockstack`
   domain. The username must be between 8 and 38 letter longs and can only contain characters, numbers and underscore (`_`).
   This is a free Blockstack identity and the format of
   the ID is:

   _`username`_`.id.blockstack`

   You'll use this initial ID to access the Blockstack Browser and other DApps.

   The **Check Availability** buttom makes sure your name is unique.

2. Press **Continue** when you find an available name you like.

   The application prompts you to enter a password. Blockstack uses this
   password to encrypt your recovery code. You must record and save this
   initial password.

    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/browser/images/create-id-2.png)

   {% include note.html content="The Blockstack team cannot restore your password for you." %}

3. Enter a password, confirm it, and press **Register ID**.

   Blockstack creates an id for you and then prompts you for an email.

   ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/browser/images/create-id-3.png)

   Blockstack uses this email address to send you recovery information. This email is only sent once.

4. Press **Next**.

    Blockstack presents you with the completed ID. 

    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/browser/images/create-id-4.png)

    The system prompts you to save your **recovery code**.

5. Click **Secret Recovery Key** to record your key.

    The system warns you to save your key:

6. Click **Secret Recovery Key** to record your key.

    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/browser/images/create-id-5.png)

    A recovery code is a sequence  of words. These words allow you to recover
    an `id.blockstack` that you've created. You should store the words along
    with their order, for example,  `#1 applied` and so forth.


6. Copy your **Secret Recovery Key**  and press **Continue**.

   The system confirms you have saved your key by asking you to select two words.

7. Choose **Go to Blockstack**.

   It may take several moments for your username to be recorded on the blockchain. You can still use it but you may see a computer-friendly ID sequence such as `ID-1G9318bjf6FAZvD3gnaSyzUojM6f8xKWK1` until the recording is finalized.

Congratulations you have created your first ID. You are now ready to start using DApps.
