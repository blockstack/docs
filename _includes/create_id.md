To create an initial Blockstack ID, do the following:

1. Open the <a href="https://browser.blockstack.org/sign-up?redirect=%2F" target="\_blank">Blockstack web application in your browser</a>.

   The application prompts you to create or restore an ID.

   ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/browser/images/create-id-1.png)

2. Choose **Create new ID**.

   The browser prompts you to register a unique username in the `id.blockstack`
   domain. This is a free Blockstack identity and the format of
   the ID is:

   _`username`_`.id.blockstack`

   You'll use this initial ID to access the Blockstack Browser and other DApps.

   The **Check Availability** buttom makes sure your name is unique.

2. Press **Continue** when you find an available name you like.

   The application prompts you to enter a password. Blockstack uses this
   password to encrypt your recovery code.  You must record and save this
   initial password.

   **NOTE**:The Blockstack team cannot restore your password for you.

3. Enter a password, confirm it, and press **Register ID**.


   Blockstack creates an id for you and then prompts you for an email.

   ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/browser/images/create-id-3.png)

   Blockstack uses this email address to send you recovery information.

4.  Press **Next**.

    Blockstack presents you with the completed ID.

    The system prompts you to save your **recovery code**.

5. Click **Secret Recovery Key** to record your key.

    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/browser/images/create-id-4.png)

    A recovery code is a sequence  of words.  These words allow you to recover
    an `id.blockstack` that you've created.  You should store the words along
    with their order, for example,  `#1 applied` and so forth.

Congratulations you have created your first ID. You are now ready to start using DApps.
