To create an initial Blockstack ID, do the following:

1. Open the <a href="https://browser.blockstack.org/sign-up?redirect=%2F" target="\_blank">Blockstack web application in your browser</a>.

   The application prompts you for an email address.

   ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/browser/images/create-id-0.png)

   Blockstack uses this email address to send you recovery information.

2. Enter an email address and press **Next**.

   The application prompts you to enter a password. Blockstack users this
   password to encrypt your recovery code.  You must record and save this
   initial password.

   **NOTE**:The Blockstack team cannot restore your password for you.

3. Enter a password, confirm it, and press **Next**.

   ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/browser/images/create-id-1.png)

   The browser prompts you to register a unique username in the `id.blockstack`
   domain. This is your identity in the decentralized internet. The format of the id
   is:

    _`username`_`.id.blockstack`

    You'll use this initial ID to access the Blockstack Browser.

3.  Enter a unique username and press **Check Availability**.

    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/browser/images/create-id-2.png)

    When you choose an ID that is available, the system responds with the following:

    ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/browser/images/create-id-3.png)

4.  Press **Continue**.

    The system prompts you to save your **recovery code**. A recovery code is a
    sequence  of words.  These words allow you to recover an `id.blockstack`
    that you've created.  You should store the words along with their order, for
    example,  `#1 applied` and so forth.

5. Click **I have written down all the words** when you are done.

   The system places you in the Blockstack browser.  You can begin exploring and
   using Dapps.
