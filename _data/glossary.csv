blockstack id,See id.blockstack,
Burning,Burning a token means that the token is transferred to an address that is a black hole—one that is not owned by any entity and for which guessing the applicable private key is effectively impossible based on known mathematical principles. This effectively destroys the token by making it unavailable for future use and decreases the total number of tokens available from that point forward.,Filing

crypto-asset,"A digital asset which utilises cryptography, peer-to-peer networking, and a public ledger to regulate the creation of new units, verify transactions, and secure the transactions without the intervention of any middleman.",Filing
cryptography,"The practise and study of encryption and decryption - encoding data so that it can only be decoded by specific individuals. A system for encrypting and decrypting data is a cryptosystem. These usually involve an algorithm for combining the original data (plaintext) with one or more keys - numbers or strings of characters known only to the sender and/or recipient. The resulting output is known as ciphertext.
The security of a cryptosystem usually depends on the secrecy of (some of) the keys rather than with the supposed secrecy of the algorithm. A strong cryptosystem has a large range of possible keys so that it is not possible to just try all possible keys (a brute force approach). A strong cryptosystem will produce ciphertext which appears random to all standard statistical tests. A strong cryptosystem will resist all known previous methods for breaking codes (cryptanalysis).",General Tech
decentralized application (dapp),"A dapp is a service that enables direct interaction between end users and providers (e.g. connecting buyers and sellers in some marketplace, owners and storers in file storage).

digital finger print,"A digital fingerprint is a unique number of a fixed length that can be produced by running any set of digital information through something called a cryptographic hash function. Each set of digital information (including a digital asset, and the digital record of any network operation on that digital asset) should (as a practical matter) have a unique digital fingerprint, which allows that set of digital information to be identified. However, it is almost impossible to recreate a digital asset from its digital fingerprint. The Blockstack network uses industry-standard algorithms such as SHA-256 to create digital fingerprints.",Filing
digital signature,"A digital signature is a sequence of digital information combining a user’s private key and any digital information that the user wishes to sign. Any other party can use the user’s paired public key to verify that the digital signature is authentic, i.e. that it was generated from a particular piece of digital information and the user’s private key.",Filing

fork,"The term fork is used to refer both to any situation where there are two or more competing versions of a blockchain on a network (a situation that may arise and resolve itself in the ordinary course of network operations due to lags in communication between core nodes) and any software update that is proposed for adoption by the core nodes of a blockchain network that may result in a persistent fork on the network, with core nodes that adopt the update recognizing one version of the blockchain and those which do not recognizing another.",Filing
Gaia,Decentralized storage ,Blockstack Tech
genesis block,"The genesis block is the first block of the Stacks blockchain, which will create the initial 1.32 billion Stacks Tokens. A hard fork is a proposed fork to the software governing a blockchain network that allows new network operations to be performed that are deemed invalid under the pre-fork network software. Because core nodes that have not adopted a hard fork, or non-adopting nodes, will therefore generally not recognize the validity of the new blockchain created by core nodes that adopt the update, or adopting core nodes, adopting core nodes are effectively incompatible with, or no longer part of the same network as, non-adopting core nodes, potentially resulting in a permanent fork and split into separate networks with different properties if adoption of the update gains some support among core nodes but does not achieve consensus.",Filing
id.blockstack,"An identifier in the Blockstack, for example mmanthony.id.blockstack.  This is your name & identity that is registered in the .id namespace on Blockstack. Your personal data and storage are built around this ID. Apps that want to access your data use your permission and identity to find it.

mining,"Mining generally refers to the process of performing certain functions for a network such as adding new records to a blockchain in exchange for mining rewards; it may also refer to other mechanisms whereby rewards (usually in the form of cryptocurrency) are provided for performing other tasks helpful to the network. Blockchain-based networks usually require that mining that involves adding new records to a blockchain is difficult or expensive in some way in order to make it difficult to forge an alternative copy of the blockchain, so as to help ensure that the blockchain remains secure and reliable. Miners adding records to a blockchain select which records to group together and add from the complete digital records of all network operations that users intend to perform but which have not yet been added; accordingly users may also attach to a network operation an optional incentive payment to be received by a miner for adding that operation to the blockchain, in order to increase the likelihood it is processed.",Filing
mining power,"A miner’s (or group of miners’) mining power is equal to the probability it will be selected to write a new block to the blockchain. Depending on the mechanism for mining, this is usually related to the overall share of computing power or cryptoassets the miner or miners possess relative to all miners for that blockchain.",Filing

A user generates this large random sequence locally on a computer and should never share it with anyone. Each private key has a paired sequence of digital information, called a public key, which a user can share publicly.",Filing
proof-of-burn mining,"A component of Stack miners destroy a proof-of-work-based cryptocurrency (currently Bitcoin) to
get tokens; this enables the functionality where nodes can select between conflicting
blockchain forks, as the blockchain fork with the most amount of cryptocurrency burned
is considered to be the correct fork.",
proof-of-work,"A proof-of-work system or proof-of-work mining is a mining mechanism where miners must expend computing power to solve complicated cryptographic puzzles, and prove that they have done so by writing the solution to the blockchain, in order to be allowed to add blocks to a blockchain. This is the mining system used, for example, by Bitcoin.",Filing
