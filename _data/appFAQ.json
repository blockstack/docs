        "question":"What is App Mining?",
        "answer":"<p>Traditionally the term mining in cryptocurrency refers to the process of
       contributing compute resources to the network and earning a reward. In the
       Blockstack Ecosystem, instead of just mining through computation, developers
       mine by building apps and the Blockstack community funds them simply for being
       pioneers in the emerging Blockchain software market. </p> <p>We believe app
       mining represents a revolution in app funding, allowing small teams to bootstrap
       without advertising or venture capital. Each month, qualifying apps compete for
       funding. Qualified apps are evaluated and ranked by expert app reviewers. The
       better your app, the higher payout you earn. </p> <p>The pilot run begins
       December 1st 2018, with 34 Blockstack Apps enrolled. A previous alpha run in Oct
       2018 included 17 Blockstack apps. App mining is a new mining model that we
       expect will evolve and improve over time. We look forward to feedback from our
       community regarding the App Mining process and program. </p>"

        "answer": "<p>Your app should integrate Blockstack authentication for logging into your app.
        Your finished app should be available to the public for use. In the future, App
        Mining may reward apps that have taken steps to further decentralize, such as
        utilizing Gaia storage or the publishing your app to the Blockstack Naming
        System. Test flight apps, hello-world apps and apps created through blockstack tutorials
        (e.g. animal kingdom apps) do not qualify.</p>"

        <p>Your product's launch on Product Hunt has an impact on your final App Mining ranking as stated in the algorithm information. If your app has not been “hunted” yet on Product Hunt, you have the option to hunt the app independently or to ask Product Hunt to hunt it for you. Make sure you understand the hunting process. Only hunted products can be featured by Product Hunt.

        judgements for why a certain app might be better than others.  We strive to
        engage a diverse coalition of app reviewers with the goal of making application
        ranking objective and resilient to abuse.  </p> <p>As of January 2019, the reviewers were:
	Product Hunt, Try My UI and Democracy Earth (who
        uses software to collect votes by Stacks token holders). See <a href='https://docs.blockstack.org/develop/mining_intro.html#how-apps-are-reviewed'>here</a>

        "question":"How are apps ranked?",
        "answer": "<p>App reviewers have a proprietary methodology that helps them make
         objective judgments for why one app might be better than another. Each
         app reviewers determines the data, formula, and personnel they wish to
         utilize. For example, Product Hunt can tap into their community data to
         determine relative app popularity. Reviewers must publish
         their methodology periodically to ensure transparency. </p> <p>To learn more see <a

         href='https://docs.blockstack.org/develop/mining_intro.html'>our
         documentation</a>.</p><p>Apps may have unique circumstances such that the app cannot be ranked by all the reviewers, for example, apps that require specific hardware. In these cases, reviewers that can review and rank the app will. An app’s final ranking is determined by the average of those reviewers that can fully review the app.</p>"

        your App as well.</p><p>Apps will be hunted every 6 months, so if you hunted

        that evaluate elements such as engagement, DAU/MAU ratios
        etc from the reviewed apps. Blockstack plans to incorporate metrics based
        ranking. However, before we do, any mechanism must thoughtfully incorporate the
        digital privacy rights of Blockstack users, and provide information in a way
        that cannot be gamed.</p> "

        "question":"Is App Mining Decentralized?",
        "answer": "<p>Given the pioneering nature of the program, we are being careful and starting
        in a centralized fashion that allows for necessary diligence. We don’t want to
        bake in assumptions that have not been validated. The downside of this
        protection is some level of centralization, which we are taking steps to reduce
        over time. The pilot is the just the first step in creating a fair system that
        can be relied upon by founders and contribute to the growth of the Blockstack
        ecosystem. </p> <p>Blockstack plans to move along a path to decentralization and
        App Mining will too. It is important to highlight that initially App Mining will
        purposely have a few points of centralization highlighted below, which can
        become decentralized over time (all plans are subject to change, legal approval,
        and applicable law). </p> <h5>Electing app reviewers:</h5> <p>Currently,
        Blockstack PBC elects app reviewers. In the future, we anticipate gradually
        transitioning to community elections of App Reviewers. </p> <h5>Registering
        apps:</h5> <p>Currently, registering apps is regulated by Blockstack PBC through
        app.co/mining. In the future, we anticipate transitioning to publishing on
        designated Blockstack namespaces via our public blockchain. </p> <h5>Collecting
        votes:</h5> <p>Currently, votes are aggregated by Blockstack PBC and
        administered via App.co. In the future, we expect that votes will be collected
        through the protocol itself. </p> <h5>Issuing money:</h5> <p>Currently, payouts
        are issued by Blockstack PBC. In the future, we expect that payouts will over
        time be generated and deployed on an automated basis. </p>"

        "question":"How is App Mining protected against bribery, collusion, or gaming?",
        "answer": "<p>We are taking potential threats very seriously and hope to create a fair
        system that continuously reinforces trust within our community for the long
        term. </p> <p>We are currently consulting with a team of 3 Ph.D. Game Theorist
        professors from Princeton University and New York University to determine
        thoughtful methods to protect App Mining from being attacked and/or abused. Our
        goal is to be as transparent as possible, but App Reviewers may reserve the
        right to keep some secrets in their formula to avoid bribes and gaming, and the
        algorithm that combines all of these score may be tuned in the future to account
        for new learnings. </p> <p>The Game Theorists are working with us to create a
        technical paper and broader documents like blogs explaining the overall
