## Introduction

## Tokens

Stacks ("STX") are the native tokens on the Stacks 2.0 blockchain. The smallest fraction of a STX is one micro-STX. 1.000.000 micro-STXs make one STX.

-> In order to correctly represent micro-STX, a decimal precision of 6 is required. 8 bytes should be allocated to store STX amounts appropriately.

## Fees

## Nonces

## Read-only function calls
