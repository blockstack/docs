## Introduction

Stacks 2.0 accounts are entities that own assets, like Stacks tokens. An account has an address, private key, nonce, and one or more asset balances.

-> The public-key signature system used for Stacks 2.0 accounts is [Ed25519](https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/).

## Creation

When an account is created, a 24-phrase mnemonic is generated. This is often referred to as the **seed phrase**. The seed phrase provides access to Stacks 2.0 accounts.

!> If the seed phrase is lost, access to the associated account cannot be restored. No person or organization, including Blockstack, can recover a lost seed phrase.

The easiest way to generate a new Stacks 2.0 account is to use the [Stacks 2.0 CLI](https://github.com/blockstack/cli-blockstack/tree/feature/stacks-2.0-tx):

```shell
# install CLI globally
sudo npm install -g "https://github.com/blockstack/cli-blockstack#feature/stacks-2.0-tx"

# generate a new account and store details in a new file
# '-t' option makes this a testnet account
blockstack make_keychain -t > cli_keychain.json
```

The `make_keychain` command will create following file:

```js
{
  "mnemonic": "aaa bbb ccc ddd ...",
  "keyInfo": {
    "address": "STJRM2AMVF90ER6G3RW1QTF85E3HZH37006D5ER1",
    "privateKey": "5a3f1f15245bb3fb...",
    "index": 0,
    "btcAddress": "biwSd6KTEvJcyX2R8oyfgj5REuLzczMYC1"
  }
}
```

| Field                | Description                                                                                                                                                        |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `mnemonic`           | A 24-word seed phrase used to access the account, generated using [BIP39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki) with 256 bits of entropy |
| `keyInfo.address`    | Stacks address for the account                                                                                                                                     |
| `keyInfo.privateKey` | Private key for the account. Required for [token transfers](/stacks-blockchain/transactions#stacks-token-transfer) and often referred to as `senderKey`            |
| `keyInfo.index`      | Nonce for the account, starting at 0                                                                                                                               |
| `keyInfo.btcAddress` | Corresponding BTC address for the account                                                                                                                          |

Note that the new account is instantiated implicitly. There is no need to manually instantiate it on the Stacks 2.0 blockchain.

-> Addresses are generated by hashing the public key and encoding it with [Base58Check](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Base58Check_encoding)

## Querying

### Get STX balance and nonce

STX balance and nonce can be obtained through the [`GET /v2/accounts/<stx_address>`](https://blockstack.github.io/stacks-blockchain-api/#operation/get_account_info) endpoint:

```shell
curl 'https://stacks-node-api-latest.argon.blockstack.xyz/v2/accounts/<stx_address>'
```

Sample response:

```js
{
    "balance": "0x0000000000000000002386f26f3f40ec",
    "nonce": 17
}
```

-> The balance string represents an unsigned 128-bit integer (big-endian) in hex encoding

### Get all token balances

All token balances can be obtained through the [`GET /extended/v1/address/<stx_address>/balances`](https://blockstack.github.io/stacks-blockchain-api/#operation/get_account_balance) endpoint:

```shell
curl 'https://stacks-node-api-latest.argon.blockstack.xyz/extended/v1/address/<stx_address>/balances'
```

Sample response:

```js
{
    "stx": {
        "balance": "0",
        "total_sent": "0",
        "total_received": "0"
    },
    "fungible_tokens": {},
    "non_fungible_tokens": {}
}
```

### Get all asset events

All asset events associated with the account can be obtained through the [`GET /extended/v1/address/<stx_address>/assets`](https://blockstack.github.io/stacks-blockchain-api/#operation/get_account_balance) endpoint:

```shell
curl 'https://stacks-node-api-latest.argon.blockstack.xyz/extended/v1/address/<stx_address>/assets'
```

Sample response:

```js
{
    "limit": 20,
    "offset": 0,
    "total": 0,
    "results": [
        {
            "event_index": 5,
            "event_type": "non_fungible_token_asset",
            "asset": {

                }
            }
        },
        {
            "event_index": 3,
            "event_type": "fungible_token_asset",
            "asset": {
                "asset_event_type": "mint",
                "asset_id": "ST2W14YX9SFVDB1ZGHSH40CX1YQAP9XKRAYSSVYAG.hello_world::novel-token-19",

                "recipient": "SZ2J6ZY48GV1EZ5V2V5RB9MP66SW86PYKKQ9H6DPR",
                "amount": "12"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
