## Introduction

The command line is intended for developers only. Developers can use the command
line to interact with the Stacks Blockchain as well as test and debug Stacks applications

- Make token transfer transactions
- Deploy smart contracts
- Call smart contract functions
- Generate new keychains
- Convert between testnet, mainnet keys
- Load, store, and list data in Gaia hubs

!> Many of the commands operate on unencrypted private keys. For this reason, **DO NOT** use this tool for day-to-day tasks as you risk the security of your keys.

You must install the command line before you can use the commands.

## How to install the command line

You must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) v12 or higher (v14 recommended). macOS and Linux users can avoid `sudo` or [permissions problems](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally) or by using [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). These instructions assume you are using a macOS or Linux system.

To install the command line, do the following:

### Step 1: [Download or `git clone` the command line repository code](https://github.com/blockstack/stacks.js/tree/master/packages/cli)

Downloading or cloning the repo creates a `cli-blockstack` repository on your system.

### Step 2: Change directory into the `cli-blockstack` directory

```bash
cd cli-blockstack
```

### Step 3: Install the dependencies with `npm`

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 4: Build the command line command

```bash
npm run build
```

### Step 5: Link the command

```bash
npm install -g @stacks/cli
```

### Troubleshooting the CLI installation

If you run into `EACCES` permissions errors, try the following:

- See https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally.
- Use [`Node Version Manager`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
