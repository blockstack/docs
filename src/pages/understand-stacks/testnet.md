## About testnet

The testnet is a separate blockchain from the Stacks mainnet analogous to a staging environnment. It's a network used by developers to test their apps, smart contracts, or changes to the protocol in a production-like environment. The testnet is reset frequently.

## Faucet

The testnet faucet provides you with free Stacks Token (STX) to test with. These are not the same as STX on mainnet and have no value. You can get STX from the faucet on the [Stacks Explorer Sanbdox](https://explorer.stacks.co/sandbox), or using the [API](https://blockstack.github.io/stacks-blockchain-api/#tag/Faucets)
