## Difference between Blockchain API and Stacks Node RPC API

The Stacks 2.0 Blockchain API is a centrally-hosted API that is accessible via the internet and enables interactions with the publicly-viewable state of the Stacks 2.0 blockchain, including transaction, account, and smart contract data.

The [Node RPC API](/references/stacks-rpc-api) is locally-hosted and runs on Stacks 2.0 Blockchain nodes, providing similar functionality but in a way that is scoped to that specific node, giving access to raw transaction data as the node sees it.
